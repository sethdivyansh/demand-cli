**Demand CLI** is a proxy that let miners to connect to and mine with [Demand Pool](https://dmnd.work). It serves two primary purposes: 
  1. Translation: Enables miners using StratumV1 to connect to the Demand Pool without requiring firmware updates. Sv1 messages gets translated to Sv2.
  2. Job Declaration (JD): Allows miners to declare custom jobs to the pool using StratumV2.


## Features
- **Stratum V2 Support**: Uses the secure and efficient Stratum V2 protocol for communication with the pool.
- **Job Declaration**: Enables miners to propose custom block templates to the pool. This helps make mining more decentralized by allowing miners to pick the transactions they want to include in a block.
- **Stratum V1 Translation**: Acts as a bridge, allowing StratumV1 miners to connect to the Demand Pool without firmware updates.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Provides options for customization. This allows users to optimize the tool for their specific mining environment.
- **Monitoring API**: Provides HTTP endpoints to monitor proxy health, pool connectivity, miner performace, and system resource usage in real-time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (version 1.70.0 or higher recommended)
- Cargo (included with Rust)
- [Bitcoin Node](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin) (Optional): Required for job declaration.

### Installation

There are two options to get started:

#### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binaries

  - Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/demand-open-source/demand-cli/releases/tag/v0.1.1).
  - Download the binary for your system.

#### Option 2: Build from Source

- Clone the repository and build the project:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/demand-open-source/demand-cli.git
    cd demand-cli
    cargo build --release
    ```

The executable will be located in the `target/release/` directory.

## Configuration

Before running the CLI, set up the necessary environment variables.

### Environment Variables

- **`TOKEN` (Required)**: Your Demand Pool authentication token.  
  Export it with:

  ```bash
  export TOKEN=<your_token>
  ```

- **`TP_ADDRESS` (Optional)**: Template Provider address (default: `127.0.0.1:8442`). Set this if you want to use job declaration feature.

  Export it with
  ```bash
  export TP_ADDRESS=<node_ip:port>
  ```
Note: if `TP_ADDRESS` id not set, job declaration is disabled, and the proxy uses  templates provided by the pool.

## Running the CLI

Depending on whether you built from source or downloaded a binary, the command to run the proxy is slightly different. There are also different options you can use. 
Below are two example setups to get you started.

#### Example 1: Built from Source with Job Declaration

This example assumes you’ve built `demand-cli` from source and want to enable job declaration.

   ```bash
   export TOKEN=abc123xyz
   export TP_ADDRESS=192.168.1.100:8442
   ./target/release/demand-cli -d 100T --loglevel debug --nc on
  ```

Connect Miners:
Point your Stratum V1 miners  to <your_proxy_ip>:32767.

#### Example 2: Pre Binary without Job Declaration
This example assumes you downloaded a pre-built binary (for linux in this case) for from release page and wants to connect test endpoint
Set Environment Variable:
  ```bash
  export TOKEN=xyz789abc
  ./demand-cli-linux-x64 -d 10T --test
  ```

Point your Stratum V1 miners  to <your_proxy_ip>:32767.

### Options

  - **`--test`**: Connects to test endpoint
  - **`-d`**: Expected downstream hashrate (e.g., `10T`, `2.5P`, `5E`). Default is `100TH/s` (100 Terahashes/second).  
    This helps the pool adjust to your hashrate.
  - **`--loglevel`**: Logging verbosity (`info`, `debug`, `error`, `warn`). Default is `info`.
  - **`--nc`**: Noise connection logging verbosity (`info`, `debug`, `error`, `warn`). Default is `off`.


## Monitoring API:

  The proxy exposes REST API enspoints to monitor its health, pool connectivity, connected mining devices performance and system resource usage. All endpoints are served on `http://0.0.0.0:3001` and return JSON responses in the format:

  ```json
  {
    "success": boolean,
    "message": string | null,
    "data": object | string | null
  }
  ```
